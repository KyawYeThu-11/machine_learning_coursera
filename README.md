## How to Use
The exercises in this course use Octave1 or MATLAB, a high-level programming language well-suited for numerical computations. If you do not have Octave or MATLAB installed, please refer to the installation instructions in the “Environment Setup Instructions” of the course website. At the Octave/MATLAB command line, typing help followed by a function name displays documentation for a built-in function. For example, `help plot` will bring up help information for plotting. Further documentation for
Octave functions can be found at the [Octave documentation pages](https://octave.org/doc/v6.4.0/). MATLAB documentation can be found at the [MATLAB documentation pages](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/).

> This repository is just to showcase the projects I've implemented along the course. Please be aware that it's pointless to mindlessly copy-paste code especially during the learning process and be mindful of [**Coursera Honor Code**](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US).
